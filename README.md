# CodeIgniter `Model` extension

This libraries extend CodeIgniter's basic model adding generic methods like `get()`, `create()`, `get_by_<foreign_key>`, etc.

## How to use

Simply put the 3 files in your `system/application/libraries` folder and have your models extend `MY_Model` instead of `Model`, add some data to the class constructor and you're done.

Check the source for more info on how they work. I created these a long time ago and no longer use them, so I don't really have time to create docs for this.
